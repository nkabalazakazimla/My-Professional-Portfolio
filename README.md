### About

This repository is my professional portfolio, showcasing the specialized **AI and Machine Learning projects** I developed during my intensive bootcamp with **CAPACITI**. As I continue advancing my professional development within the organization, this collection highlights the technical models, intelligent systems, and data‑driven solutions I’ve designed to date.

My work reflects structured learning, practical experimentation, and a growing commitment to building technology that solves real problems with clarity and purpose. Each project serves as a marker of the skills I’m sharpening and the direction I’m shaping in the AI and Machine Learning space.
